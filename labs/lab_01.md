##Exercise 1_0 
1. Install Python version 2.7.10 
https://www.python.org 

2. Get java 

	* If you are on a mac, you'll need to install java. 
You can get apple's java here
https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US 

	
	* If you are on windows you might also need to do this step. Download java SE for runtime 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html 


3.Install Pycharm's Community Edition: 
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ 

4.Open up pycharm and create a new project 
	File > New Project 	
	It will open this pop up.

Make sure you select the version of python that's 2.7.10 that's in the Library folder if you're on a mac. On windows this will not be a problem. You'll just see it listed here. 

On windows you might need to add a system path environmental variable. This will be the most annoyingly low level thing you'll do all term if so. I'm hopeful that pycharm does it for you but if not it will be needed to be done by hand. Here's some info. https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html
